# GunDamagePlus / 枪械增强插件

[简体中文](README_zh.md)

---

**GunDamagePlus** is a _LeviLamina_ plugin designed to address common issues with custom Addon firearms in the original Minecraft Bedrock Edition. It removes the invincibility frames during the throwing of projectiles (bullets), enabling true consecutive shooting damage, and supports recording the source of the damage.

### Function 

1. **Kill Notification Fix**: This plugin will automatically set the owner (the player who fired the shot) as the initiator when the projectile is initialized. The kill information will correctly display the player's name and trigger the corresponding script events. 

2. **No hurt time**: This plugin specifically removes the invincibility cooldown for projectile-type damage. Every bullet that hits will cause damage, making machine gun weapons no longer ineffective. 

### Installation 

1. Download the compressed file.
2. Extract the compressed file to the `plugins` folder in the server directory.
3. Start the server.
